Scenario: Verify SSH connectivity using both password and key-based authentication.

Setup:

Two machines: a client and a server.
SSH server installed and running on the server machine.
User accounts on the server for testing both authentication methods.
For key-based auth: SSH keys generated and public key added to the server's authorized_keys file for the test user.

Teardown:

Remove test user accounts and their home directories from the server.
Remove test SSH keys from the client and server.

Tools Used:

SSH client software on the client machine.
Server logs on the server machine to verify connection attempts.

Pass Criteria:

For password-based authentication: The client successfully establishes an SSH connection to the server using the test user's password.
For key-based authentication: The client successfully establishes an SSH connection to the server without being prompted for the test user's password.
Server logs confirm the successful authentication and connection for both methods.

Fail Criteria:

The client fails to establish an SSH connection using either authentication method.
The server logs indicate authentication failures or do not show any attempt from the client machine.
